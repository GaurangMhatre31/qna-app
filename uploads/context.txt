PROJECT
Automated QA Model for PDF and Word Files
Developed an automated question-answering model using a BERT-based transformer to process both PDF and
Word documents. Implemented seamless text extraction without requiring file-type input from the user, enabling
users to directly upload files. Integrated speech recognition for voice-based question input and text-to-speech to
deliver spoken responses, providing a more interactive experience. Technologies used include Python,
Transformers, PyPDF2, python-docx, and pyttsx3..
Multilingual Medical Diagnosis Chatbot
based on symptoms spoken in Hindi, Marathi, or English. Utilized `SpeechRecognition` for voice input,
`googletrans` for language detection, `TF-IDF` and Logistic Developed a voice-enabled chatbot in Python that
provides medical diagnoses and medicine suggestions Regression for symptom-based diagnosis, and `gTTS` for
spoken responses, enhancing user accessibility in native languages.
OpenCV Object Detection System
Developed a real-time object detection system using OpenCV and Python, implementing image processing
algorithms to identify and classify objects from video feeds. Enhanced detection accuracy and speed, creating an
interactive interface to visualize results effectively.
